## How to submit code

* Code must be tested (every function must have at least one test)
* Every function must have a doc string

### How to write a commit message

Use Fix #10 if the commit fixes issue 10. This will close the issue and add a reference to it.

All commit messages must follow the following four rules from [the seven rules of a great Git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/):

* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
* Capitalize the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line

For example: "Remove deprecated methods Fix #15"
